Gom is a statically typed, multi-paradigm programming language based on a subset of the ECMAScript (and Rust) syntax but providing type-safety and concise syntax. It can be interpreted or compiled to LLVM IR. It takes inspiration from AssemblyScript and makes it more approachable to learn compiler construction.

Here’s a typical hello world program in Gom:

```
import io;

fn main() {
	io.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
